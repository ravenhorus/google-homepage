This is my google-homepage practice page from theodinproject.com on the HTML/CSS/GIT course.

At the end of this project i expect to have mastered the real basics of HTML/CSS/GIT.

If you want to start learning coding is a great idea to visit The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
